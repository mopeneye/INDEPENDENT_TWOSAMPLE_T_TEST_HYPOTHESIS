# INDEPENDENT_TWOSAMPLE_T_TEST_HYPOTHESIS

# PRICING
# A game company gave gift coins to its users for purchasing items in a game.
# Users buy various vehicles for their characters using these virtual coins.
# The game company did not specify a price for an item and provided users to buy this item at the price they wanted.
# For example, for the item named shield, users will buy this shield by paying the amounts they see fit.
# For example, a user can pay with 30 units of virtual money given to him, while the other user can pay with 45 units.
# Therefore, users can buy this item with the amounts they can afford to pay.

# Problems to be solved:
# 1. Does the item's price differ by category? Express it statistically.
# 2. What should the price of the item be depending on the first question? Explain why?
# 3. It is desirable to be "mobile" about the price. Create a decision support system for the price strategy and
# 4. Simulate item purchases and income for possible price changes.
